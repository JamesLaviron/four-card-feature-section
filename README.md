## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- BEM methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS mixins
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- Logical properties
- Responsive IMG
- Reset file

### What I learned

I learned how to work easily with grids and flex boxes. It seems now more familiar to me. However I still don't think I did the best integration ever as soon as I use 2 media queries in order to handle it.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on flex boxes and grids. I still need to figure out how to make it as simple as possible while keeping it responsive.

### Useful resources
